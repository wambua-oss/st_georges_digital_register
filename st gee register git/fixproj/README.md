# St. George's Digital Attendance Register — Vite

## Deployment
1. Upload this folder/repository to GitHub.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Framework: Vite. Build command: `vite build` (or `npm run build`).
4. Output directory: `dist`.
5. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel Environment Variables.
6. Deploy.

## Supabase
Run `supabase/FINAL_SYNC_ALL.sql` once in the Supabase SQL Editor. This is the clean final schema used by the application. It rebuilds the application tables and removes their existing rows; Supabase Auth users are not deleted.

Learner import columns are exactly: `Admission No.`, `KEMIS No.`, `Full Name`, `Gender`, `Residence`, `Section`, `Grade`, `Stream`.

Deploy all four Edge Functions under `supabase/functions/` and set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for them.

## Login
The login screen has two separate entry points: Class Teacher and Administrator. The selected account type is checked against the authenticated user's `profiles.role`. An Admin cannot sign in through the Class Teacher option, and a Class Teacher cannot sign in through the Administrator option.

## Attendance
Only Present and Absent are available. There are bulk Mark All Present / Mark All Absent buttons plus individual buttons for every learner.

## Learners
The Learners page uses `full_name` and `nemis_no`; there are no `learners.name` or UPI references in the application.


## Dashboard Search Update
The dashboard now supports Whole School, Grade/Class, Stream, and Individual Learner attendance selection. Grade and Stream are dropdowns, streams for the selected grade are also shown as selectable chips, and the selected class/grade/stream is displayed in the dashboard header.
